    "Begin by examining the basic statistics of key features such as trip distance, fare amount, tip amount, and other relevant metrics.\n",
    "Check for missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the dataset.\n",

    "2. Create visualizations to explore the distribution of key variables, e.g., trip distance, fare amount, tip amount, using histograms, box plots, or kernel density plots.\n",
    "Visualize geographical patterns by plotting pickup and drop-off locations on a map.\n",
    "Explore the distribution of trips over time, considering both pickup and drop-off times.\n",
    "Find interesting trip statistics grouped by hour:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyze and visualize trip statistics grouped by hour, such as the average trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount.\n",
    "Identify peak hours or time periods with higher trip demand.\n",
    "The taxi drivers want to know what kind of trip yields better tips. Can you build a model for them and explain the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Train a predictive model (e.g., regression model) to estimate tip amount based on relevant features like trip distance, fare amount, payment type, and others.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).\n",
    "Explain the significant features influencing tips and provide insights for maximizing tips.\n",
    "(Option 2) Visualize the data to help understand trip patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize trip patterns by creating heatmaps or density plots of pickup and drop-off locations.\n",
    "Explore how trip patterns change over the course of a day or week.\n",
    "Identify any clusters or hotspots of frequent trips."
