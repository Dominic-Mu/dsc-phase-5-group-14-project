    "Our project focuses on using machine learning techniques and data sourced from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program to generate predictive models aimed at evaluating individual and household health risks in Kenya. By analyzing various set of demographic, socio-economic, and health-related indicators, we target to develop reliable predictive models capable of estimating the likelihood of malnutrition, disease prevalence, and various health risks within certain communities. The goal is to provide users such as public health officials with targeted insights. This will enable more effective allotment of resources and interventions. This proactive approach is geared to optimize the impact of health initiatives, allowing for the prioritization and customization of interventions to at risk populations, ultimately contributing to the improvement of health outcomes in Kenya."

    "Despite existing health interventions, Kenya encounters difficulties in effectively targeting resources and interventions. This will help to address individual and household health risks, including malnutrition, diseases, and other health concerns. This fault highlights the need for a predictive and targeted approach to allocate resources and interventions more effectively. Leveraging machine learning models built upon Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data, the project aims to develop predictive models capable of assessing the likelihood of malnutrition, disease prevalence, and health risks based on individual and household characteristics. By accurately identifying at-risk populations, this solution seeks to empower decision-makers and public health officials to allocate resources on need basis, ultimately increasing the impact of health interventions and improving overall health outcomes in Kenya."
