#     ## Business Overview

#     You're probably wondering why this APP? Well, road safety remains a critical concern around the world, with distracted driving claimed as being a leading cause of accidents. Distracted driving accounts for at least **9%** of annual car accidents in USA and is the leading cause of accidents worldwide.  

#     According to an NTSA report on accidents in 2023, **1,072** people were killed on our roads, with the main causes being drunk driving, speeding and distracted driving. In Kenya we already have measures in place to tackle the first two: Alcoblow for drunk-driving, speed guns and speed governors for speeding. There seems to be nothing in place to tackle the third cause and that is where our project comes in.  

#     This project aims to leverage computer vision and machine learning techniques to develop a system capable of detecting distracted drivers in real-time, contributing to enhanced road safety measures.

#     ## Problem Statement

#     Distracted driving poses significant risks, including accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Identifying and mitigating instances of distraction while driving is crucial to reducing road accidents.  

#     The ballooning of car insurance claims led Directline Insurance, Kenya, to engage us in this project, with a vision to lower the rising claims from their customers.
